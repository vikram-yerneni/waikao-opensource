Your contributions—whether they're code, documentation, bug reports, or feature requests—are highly valued and appreciated.

### How to Get Started

4. 	Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your contribution. We recommend using a clear, descriptive name (e.g., feat/add-new-endpoint or fix/handle-auth-error). git checkout -b your-branch-name
